# forum


'forum' is a message board with Laravel on the back-end and Vue.js handling the front. The components are reusable, flash messaging is implemented, and I use ajax calls for a lot of the user interactions. I use Redis for generating popular posts and keeping track of which pages have been viewed by a user. Right now I am adding in mail notifications for user account verification. 

The main goal in creating this was to use TDD.
